# Quantum Hair Echo Simulation
Code for simulating graviton echo signals with quantum hair model. Includes:
- Echo injection into LIGO-like noise
- CNN classification pipeline (conceptual)
- Figure generation scripts

Developed as part of the research paper: "Graviton Echoes from Quantum Hair: A Theoretical Probe Beyond the Black Hole No-Hair Theorem"
